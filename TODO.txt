#it appears QED is determining its running under MiNT when it isn't?
#After a Pdomain() call, Pgeteuid() and Pgetgid() are called?
Fixed. QED runs fine as m68k binary.

Do not forget to change MMU code in BaS_gcc to protect system vectors and sysvars!

Interface (resource editor, apparently Pure C compiled) checks for an arithmetic coprocessor
at 0xfffa42 (control register of the Atari coprocessor card). For this, it replaces the
adress error handler using Supexec(). We need to catch this access attempt and pretend we don't
have a coprocessor.
